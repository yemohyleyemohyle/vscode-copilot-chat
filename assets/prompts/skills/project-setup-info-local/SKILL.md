## mcp-server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server project. This project supports multiple programming languages including TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, C#, Java, and Kotlin.

### Rules

1. First, visit https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol to find the correct SDK and setup instructions for the requested language. Default to TypeScript if no language is specified.
2. Use the `copilot_fetchWebPage` tool to find the correct implementation instructions from https://modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt
3. Update the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory to include references to the SDK documentation
4. Create an `mcp.json` file in the `.vscode` folder in the project root with the following content: `{ "servers": { "mcp-server-name": { "type": "stdio", "command": "command-to-run", "args": [list-of-args] } } }`.
   - mcp-server-name: The name of the MCP server. Create a unique name that reflects what this MCP server does.
   - command-to-run: The command to run to start the MCP server. This is the command you would use to run the project you just created.
   - list-of-args: The arguments to pass to the command. This is the list of arguments you would use to run the project you just created.

   Note that "python-script" and "true" are constants while "New Project Name" and "/path/to/new/project" are placeholders for the project name and path respectively.
   ```json
   {
     "name": "python-envs.createNewProjectFromTemplate",
     "commandId": "python-envs.createNewProjectFromTemplate",
     "args": ["python-script", "true", "New Project Name", "/path/to/new/project"]
   }
   ```

## python-package

A Python package project which can be used to create a distributable package.

Required extensions: `ms-python.python`, `ms-python.vscode-python-envs`
