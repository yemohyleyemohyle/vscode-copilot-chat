# How to setup a project using context7 tools

Use context7 tools to find the latest libraries, APIs, and documentation to help the user create and customize their project. Only setup a project if the folder is empty or if you've just called the tool first calling the tool to create a workspace.

1. Call the `mcp_context7_resolve-library-id` tool with your project requirements.
2. Call the `mcp_context7_get-library-docs` tool to get scaffolding instructions.
