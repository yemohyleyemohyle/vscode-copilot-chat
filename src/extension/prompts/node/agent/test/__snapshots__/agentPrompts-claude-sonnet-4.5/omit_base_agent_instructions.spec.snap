<reminderInstructions>
Do NOT create a new markdown file to document each change or summarize your work unless specifically requested by the user.

IMPORTANT: Before calling any deferred tool that was not previously returned by tool_search_tool_regex, you MUST first use tool_search_tool_regex to load it. Calling a deferred tool without first loading it will fail. Tools returned by tool_search_tool_regex are automatically expanded and immediately available - do not search for them again.
